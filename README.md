# Planar Data Classification using a Neural Network with One Hidden Layer

This Jupyter notebook is part of Week 3 of the Deep Learning Specialization by DeepLearning.AI. It focuses on building and understanding a simple neural network model with a single hidden layer to classify non-linearly separable data.

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives

By completing this notebook, you will:

- Build a simple neural network for binary classification from scratch
- Understand forward and backward propagation
- Compute cross-entropy loss
- Use non-linear activation functions such as `tanh`
- Observe the difference between logistic regression and neural networks
- Visualize decision boundaries
- Experiment with the number of hidden units and observe their effect

## ðŸ§  Topics Covered

- Dataset loading and visualization
- Logistic regression vs neural networks
- Initializing model parameters
- Forward propagation
- Cost computation (Cross-Entropy)
- Backward propagation
- Parameter update (Gradient Descent)
- Building an end-to-end model: `nn_model`
- Prediction function: `predict`
- Performance evaluation
- Hidden layer size tuning
